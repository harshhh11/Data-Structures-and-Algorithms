# Data Structures

A Data Structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently.

We talk about data structures as: 
1) Mathematical/logical models or Abstract Data Type - Define data operations, but no implementation

Eg:- List - ADT
- Store a given number of elements of any data type
- Read elements by position
- Modify element of a position
Array is a Concrete Implmentation of List

2) Concrete Implementation - Implementation of ADTs
Array - Concrete Implementation

Linked List - Concrete Implementation

### Problems with Array 

if the list of elements is too small, some part of array might not be used and wasted 

if the list grows too much, in worst case, a new array needs to be created and elements of prev array will be copied to new array (again a costly operation)
Solution -> Linked List
